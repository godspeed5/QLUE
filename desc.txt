cal calculateNearestHigher_classic_mod_hard(dataset, tileDict, outlierDeltaFactor*dc, delC, phoC, delM)

dc = window for nearest higher = 20 in original python Qlue and same here

dm_in = tile size for nearest higher search (2*dc)
delC = window for seed search = dc in principle. I used delC = dc/2 though
rho_c = critical rho used for everything (phoC in main) = 25
delM = outlier distance threshold = 10 in exp
